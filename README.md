My Ironhack video game project

### What is this about?

This is a small video game developed in just one week while studying at Ironhack. 
The objective was no other that increasing our programming skills in Javascript, and face the challenge of programming a 
functional game in very limited amount of time.

The game is developed using the canvas HTML element to display the graphic component.


Hope you like it.
